# TEST-SQL
### Project Overview
TESTSQL is a comprehensive system that empowers second-year computer science lectures with tools necessary to create and automate SQL assignments for their database courses. The system streamlines the process of creating assignments by allowing lecturers to tailor assessments based on desired criteria. With the aid of an efficient database, the system will generate unique assignments for each student, ensuring fairness and combatting cheating. Additionally, the system includes an automatic grading component that evaluates and provides feedback to student submissions. This helps improve the overall efficiency and value of the SQL assignment management process at the UCT (University of Cape Town) (University of Cape Town) Computer Science department.
